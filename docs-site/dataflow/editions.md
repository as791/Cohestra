  import/export.
- Multi-tenant row-level security, audit events, workspace roles.
- A free execution-quota tier.

## Commercial

Per-tenant entitlements, purchasable in-product:

| Feature | What it unlocks |
| --- | --- |
| Advanced connectors | Premium connector paths |
| Realtime | Streaming/realtime execution |
| Spark SQL | Spark SQL steps on the compute control plane |
| Flink SQL | Flink SQL steps on the compute control plane |
| Stateful processing | Stateful stream operations |
